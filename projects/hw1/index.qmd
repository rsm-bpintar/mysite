## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

_to do: expand on the description of the experiment._

PUblished in 2007, this experiment was inspired by America's significant increase in private charitable giving in the decades prior. It was alluded to the fact that a combination of increased wealth and an aging population in America likely caused this increase. Their analysis originally concluded that the match offer increases both the revenue per solicitation and the response rate. However, larger match ratios (i.e., $3:$1 instead of $1:$1) did not have any additional impact. It was also concluded that the matching had a much larger effect in red states than blue states.

This project seeks to replicate their results.

### Balance Test 

As an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.

_todo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation -mrm2) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. For at least one variable, perform the test as both t-test (use the formula in the class slides) and separately as a linear regression (regress for example mrm2 on treatment); confirm both methods yield the exact same results. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)._

```{python}
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import t

def t_test_randomization_check(df, column, treat_col='treatment', control_col='control'):
    """
    Performs Welch's t-test to compare treatment and control groups for a given variable.

    Parameters:
    - df: pandas DataFrame
    - column: name of the column to compare (e.g., 'mrm2')
    - treat_col: name of the treatment indicator column (default: 'treatment')
    - control_col: name of the control indicator column (default: 'control')
    """

    # Extract the groups
    treat = df[df[treat_col] == 1][column].dropna()
    control = df[df[control_col] == 1][column].dropna()

    # Means and standard deviations
    mean_treat = treat.mean()
    mean_control = control.mean()
    std_treat = treat.std(ddof=1)
    std_control = control.std(ddof=1)

    # Sample sizes
    n_treat = len(treat)
    n_control = len(control)

    df_welch = df_numerator / df_denominator

    # p-value
    p_value = 2 * (1 - t.cdf(np.abs(t_stat), df=df_welch))

    # Output
    print(f"\n🧪 T-Test for '{column}': Treatment vs Control")
    print(f"Treatment mean: {mean_treat:.2f}; Control mean: {mean_control:.2f}")
    print(f"Treatment std dev: {std_treat:.2f}; Control std dev: {std_control:.2f}")
    print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
    print(f"Degrees of freedom: {df_welch:.2f}")
    print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")

    # Decision
    if p_value < 0.05:
        print("❗ Reject the null hypothesis: The groups are significantly different.")
    else:
        print("✅ Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference between groups.")


t_test_randomization_check(df, 'mrm2')
t_test_randomization_check(df, 'female')
t_test_randomization_check(df, 'red0')

```

Let's compare results with a linear regression.

```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sm

df_reg = df[['mrm2', 'treatment']].dropna()

#define x and y
X = df_reg['treatment']
X = sm.add_constant(X)
y = df_reg['mrm2']

#fit model
model = sm.OLS(y,X).fit()

#extract values
coef = model.params['treatment']
t_stat = model.tvalues['treatment']
p_value = model.pvalues['treatment']

print(f"Coefficient (treatment): {coef:.4f}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

P-values match accordingly confirming method.

Table 1 is included in the original report to provide evidence of randomization of the treatment and control groups. This is proven to be true, being that we fail to reject the null hypothesis with no statistically significant difference in demographics for treatment and control groups.

## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

_todo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control._

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#calculate proportions
prop_treatment = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave'].mean()
prop_control = df[df['control'] == 1]['gave'].mean()

#data for plot
groups = ['Treatment', 'Control']
proportions = [prop_treatment, prop_control]

#plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.bar(groups, proportions)
plt.ylabel('Proportion Donated')
plt.title('Donation Rate by Group')
plt.ylim(0,.05)
plt.show()
```

_todo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made (you can do this as a bivariate linear regression if you want). It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A. Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or something that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)_

```{python}
df_lpm = df[['gave', 'treatment']].dropna()

#define outcome and predictor
X = sm.add_constant(df_lpm['treatment'])
y = df_lpm['gave']

#fit linear regression
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

#extract stats
coef = model.params['treatment']
t_stat = model.tvalues['treatment']
p_value = model.pvalues['treatment']

#output
print(f"Coefficient (treatment effect): {coef:.4f}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

Summary here: treatment effect is statistically significant.

_todo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control._ 

```{python}
df_probit = df[['gave', 'treatment']].dropna()

#define predictors and outcome
X = sm.add_constant(df_probit['treatment'])
y = df_probit['gave']

#fit probit model
probit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()

print(probit_model.summary())

mfx = probit_model.get_margeff()
print(mfx.summary())
```

Results indicate an increase in probability of donating by 0.43%, holding all else constant. This is consistent with the linear regression results, as effect is small. P-values also match. Treatment has a significant but modest positive effect on probability of donation.

_NOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions..._


### Differences between Match Rates

Next, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the "figures suggest" comment the authors make on page 8?_

    if p_value < 0.05:

    else:
        print("❌ Not statistically significant at the 5% level.")

t_test_donation_rate(df, 1, 3)

```

Author suggests that neither the match threshold or example amount had a meaningful influence on behavior. Results above suggest the same. Not enough evidence to conclude that the difference in donation rates is statistically significant.

_todo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable `ratio1` then regress `gave` on `ratio1`, `ratio2`, and `ratio3` (or alternatively, regress `gave` on the categorical variable `ratio`). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision._

Create the ratio1 variable.
```{python}
#create the ratio1 variable
df['ratio_str'] = df['ratio'].astype('str')
df['ratio1'] = (df['ratio_str'] == '1').astype(int)
df['ratio2'] = (df['ratio_str'] == '2').astype(int)
df['ratio3'] = (df['ratio_str'] == '3').astype(int)
print(df[['ratio', 'ratio1', 'ratio2', 'ratio3']].head(10))

print(f"2:1 vs 1:1: {diff_2v1:.4f}")
print(f"3:1 vs 2:1: {diff_3v2:.4f}")
print(f"3:1 vs 1:1: {diff_3v1:.4f}")
```
Results from data match the regression coefficients. We can safely conclude that there is no effect that match sizes have on response rates.

### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?_
```{python}
df_reg = df[['amount', 'treatment']].dropna()

X = sm.add_constant(df_reg['treatment'])
y = df_reg['amount']

model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

coef = model.params['treatment']
pval = model.pvalues['treatment']

print(f"Treatment effect (difference in donation amount): {coef:.4f}")
print(f"p-value: {pval:.4f}")
```

Difference of 0.15 is accurate compared to Table2A of original analysis. However, p-value is greater than 0.05, so not statistically significant.

_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ 

```{python}
# Filter to donors only
df_donors = df[(df['amount'] > 0) & df['treatment'].notna()][['amount', 'treatment']]

X = sm.add_constant(df_donors['treatment'])
y = df_donors['amount']

model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

coef = model.params['treatment']
pval = model.pvalues['treatment']

print(f"Treatment effect among donors: {coef:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {pval:.4f}")
```

Similar conclusion as above. No evidence of meaningful effect since difference is not statistically significant. Effect could even be due to random variation, not a true causal effect of treatment.

_todo: Make two plots: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._

```{python}
# Filter to donors only
df_donors = df[df['amount'] > 0]

# Split groups
treatment_amounts = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 1]['amount']
control_amounts = df_donors[df_donors['control'] == 1]['amount']

# Calculate means
mean_treatment = treatment_amounts.mean()
mean_control = control_amounts.mean()

# Plot: Control Group
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.hist(control_amounts, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='gray', edgecolor='black')
plt.axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean: ${mean_control:.2f}')
plt.title('Donation Amounts (Control Group)')
plt.xlabel('Donation Amount')
plt.ylabel('Number of Donors')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Plot: Treatment Group
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.hist(treatment_amounts, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='gray', edgecolor='black')
plt.axvline(mean_treatment, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean: ${mean_treatment:.2f}')
plt.title('Donation Amounts (Treatment Group)')
plt.xlabel('Donation Amount')
plt.ylabel('Number of Donors')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Plots show very similar results.

## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers

_to do:  Simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be "noisey" when only averaging a few numbers, but should "settle down" and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader._

```{python}
# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Step 1: Simulate 10k Bernoulli draws for each group
n_draws = 10000
control_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, size=n_draws)
treatment_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, size=n_draws)

# Step 2: Compute the vector of differences
diffs = treatment_draws - control_draws  # element-wise difference

# Step 3: Compute cumulative average of the differences
cumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, n_draws + 1)

# Step 4: Plot cumulative average
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(cumulative_avg, label='Cumulative Average Treatment Effect')
plt.axhline(y=0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Difference (0.022 - 0.018)')
plt.title('Cumulative Average of Simulated Treatment Effect')
plt.xlabel('Number of Simulations')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Average Difference')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Cumulative average eventually starts to converge towards the true difference of 0.004.

### Central Limit Theorem

_to do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000.  To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader._

```{python}
# Set seed
np.random.seed(42)

# Parameters
p_control = 0.018
p_treatment = 0.022
n_simulations = 1000
sample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]

# Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))
axes = axes.flatten()

for i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):
    mean_diffs = []
    
    for _ in range(n_simulations):
        # Sample from each distribution
        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, size=n)
        treatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, size=n)

        # Calculate mean difference
        diff = treatment_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()
        mean_diffs.append(diff)
    
    # Plot histogram
    axes[i].hist(mean_diffs, bins=30, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.75)
    axes[i].axvline(np.mean(mean_diffs), color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean: {np.mean(mean_diffs):.4f}')
    axes[i].set_title(f'Sample Size = {n}')
    axes[i].set_xlabel('Mean Difference')
    axes[i].set_ylabel('Frequency')
    axes[i].legend()
    axes[i].grid(True)

# Final layout
plt.suptitle('Sampling Distribution of Mean Differences (Treatment - Control)', fontsize=16)
plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```
The sampling distribution takes on a bell-shape very quickly, even at sample size of 50, but gets smoothed out by the time sample size is 1000. Central Limit Theorem takes place earlier in the sequence than anticipated, approximating a normal distribution, but more filled in and smooth by 1000 sample size.
